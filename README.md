This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Here’s a revised version of your text:

I used SCSS, CSS, Context API, and Next.js for the project.

For the design, I didn’t complete the carousel for comics due to time constraints.

I created a folder named components where various components for the application are located. Additionally, I created a folder named types with Comic and Film types.

I also created a context folder, which I used for implementing the Context API.

There is also a styles folder where I used SCSS for styling.
